The accompanying videos are as follows:
	- Project2_eval_trig.avi
	- Project2_eval_tps.avi
	- Project2_eval_jj_to_lion_trig.avi
	- Project2_eval_jj_to_lion_tps.avi
	- Project2_eval_jj_to_lion_tps_full_cycle.avi

I made the last video just out of fun. It was created by uncommenting back in parts of the code in animation_morph_from_jj_to_lion.m. In order to generate Project2_eval_jj_to_lion_trig.avi, simply run animation_morph_from_jj_to_lion_trig. Likewise, in order to generate Project2_eval_jj_to_lion_tps.avi, simply run animation_morph_from_jj_to_lion_tps. These rely on loading the im_vals.mat file which contains the corresponding points for the given images.

This is amazing. :)
